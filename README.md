# Golds Gym

When you workout is common to look for exercises of all kinds. Maybe you want to train your chest but you don't have dumbells... There is where Golds Gym comes into action. Search exercises by muscle or by name, learn how to do them by watching Youtube videos and variations of them with different equipment or similar exercises.
Also, keeping track of what you eat is a good idea to define objectives and set goals. Because of that, Golds Gym comes with Macro and calorie calculator.

Building this project was a real challenge for me, especially when I realized one of the APIs was no longer free. I had to look for a new free Exercise API and then I found WGER API. Although I could get around it, there was a lot of work to match the information of this API with the other one. After that, I created the Macros Counter section where I had to use two different APIs for getting calories and the Macros. It was hard, but I put time, effort, and love to make it go. It can be incomplete, but I'm very proud because I fixed a lot of things on the way and never gave up.
